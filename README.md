I'm sure you're no stranger to api documentation, but when there's no common place to store it, it can lead to a variety of formats and fragmentation. This causes us to collect the api documentation is so painful. So I wonder why we don't define some important parameters in advance when we write `proto` and stuff the valid data through `comment` form. When we define the api to complete the api documentation, that's great!
